<p>
Starting in cycle 8, a new energy to PHA conversion will be used for observations 
with energy filters. Observations with ACIS-S at the aimpoint will use a conversion 
tailored for the back illuminated (BI) CCDs and those with ACIS-I at the aimpoint 
will use front illuminated (FI) CCD specific conversions.
</p>

<p>
Observations which apply an energy filter with a low energy threshold greater than 
0.5 keV will automatically be assigned spatial windows that allow the FI CCDs to use 
the FI conversion and the BI CCDs to use the BI conversion regardless of aimpoint.
