A complete listing of target information can be accessed by the Target
Search Form for your
inspection.  Targets can be sorted by sequence number or RA.  For each
target there is: 
<ul>
<LI> A summary page giving general information.
<LI> A listing of all parameters, which has been extracted from Obscat.
<LI>The instrument field of view overlaid on the Digital Sky Survey.
  Guide stars and fiducial lights are also indicated.
<LI>The instrument field of view overlaid on the X-ray field (usually a
  deep ROSAT PSPC image).  Be warned that sometimes the X-ray data were
  not available
<LI>A plot showing allowed value of roll angle as a function of date.
  Also "visibility" as a function of date.  If the target is too close
  to the sun to be observed, visibility drops to zero.
</UL>

<P>
This is a brief summary intended to give users help on searching the
ObsCat database with  <A HREF="http://asc.harvard.edu/~mta/CUS/Usint/search.html">Target Search
Form</A>.  With this form you can find all your observations and
obtain target information.  Alternatively one could find, for instance,
all observations of a favorite target using a particular instrument
and grating configuration.  Cone searches can also be performed in
conjunction with any combination of other parameters.  Furthermore,
multiple fields can be used to narrow down a search.  For example,
selecting "HRC-S" in the Science Instrument field and "LETG" in the
Grating field will find all observations using the HRC-S/LETG
combination.  Selecting "Murray" in the PI field, "00:20" in the RA
field, "-72:" in the Dec field, "5" in the Radius field and "degrees"
in the Units pull down menu will find all of Murray's observations
within a 5 degree radius centered on RA 00:20, Dec -72:.  Any
questions beyond the scope of this page should be directed to the 
HelpDesk</A>.

<TABLE CELLPADDING="5">
<TR><TD valign="top"><B><A NAME="RANGE">Range Searches<B></TD>
<TD>Range searches can be performed using the following format: # -- # e.g. entering "100000 -- 100009" in the Sequence Number field will find all searches matching or between these specified values.  Range searches can be performed on the Sequence Number, Proposal Number and Obs ID fields.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign="top"><B><A NAME="LIST">List Searches</B></TD>
<TD>Comma separated list searches can be performed using the
following format: Entering "#, #, #, etc." in the Obs ID field will
perform an exact match on every Obs ID in the list.  One may use the
asterisk (<tt>*</tt>) in an element of the list to indicate a wildcard
match.  List searches can
be performed on the Sequence Number, Proposal Number and Obs ID fields.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign="top"><B><A NAME="COORDINATES">Coordinate Searches</B></TD>
<TD>There are two types of coordinate searches: Cone and
Exact.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD></TD><TD>A cone search searches for all observations within a
certain search radius.  The user specifies the center point in the RA
and Dec fields and then a radius in either minutes or degrees.  For
example, selecting "05:37:45.38" in the RA field, "-65:38:49.87" in
the Dec field, "10" in the Radius field and "degrees" in the Units
pull down menu will find all observations within 10 degrees of the
specified coordinates.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD></TD><TD>An exact search can be performed by entering exact
coordinates in the RA and Dec fields and leaving the Units pull down
menu blank.  For example, selecting "20:02:49.60" in the RA field,
"+25:14:11.30" in the Dec field and leaving the Units pull down menu
blank will find any observations with those exact coordinates if they
exist.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign="top"><B><A NAME="WILDCARD">Wildcard matches</B></TD>
<TD>You may use the wildcard "<tt>*</tt>" on either side of a number
in the Sequence Number, Proposal Number or Obs ID fields.  A number
entered without an asterisk will be treated as an exact match.
Wildcards may be used within a comma-separated list.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><B><H2>Fields</H2></B></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign="top"><B><A NAME="SEQUENCE">Sequence Number<B></TD>
<TD>The sequence number of an observation.  Entering "50" will
retrieve observations with sequence numbers consisting of
"50".  eg. observations with sequence numbers 200050, 500044, etc.
<a href="#RANGE">Range</a> and <a href="#LIST">list</a> searches can be performed on this field.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign="top"><B><A NAME="PROPOSAL">Proposal Number<B></TD>
<TD>The proposal number of an observation.  Entering "011" will
retrieve observations with proposal numbers consisting of "011".
eg. observations with propoal numbers 01100297, 01500111, etc.  <a href="#RANGE">Range</a>
and <a href="#LIST">list</a> searches can be performed on this field.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign="top"><B><A NAME="PINAME">PI Name<B></TD>
<TD>The last name of the Principal Investigator for an observation.
Entering "ha" will retrieve observations from PI's with an "ha" in
their last name.  eg. Sharp, Hayes, etc.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign="top"><B><A NAME="OBSERVER">Observer<B></TD>
<TD>The last name of the Observer for an observation.  Entering "ki"
will retrieve observations from Observers with a "ki" in their last
name.  eg.  Akins, Kilgard, etc.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign="top"><B><A NAME="TARGET">Target<B></TD>
<TD>The name of the Target for an observation.  Entering "NGC"
will retrieve observations of Targets with an "NGC" in their name.
eg.  NGC3310, NGC3256, etc.  By default, the target search performs
an exact match anchored to the beginning of the search string, so
searching for GC3256 will find nothing.  It is recommended that
<a href="#SIMBAD">Simbad</a> name resolving be used if you do not know EXACTLY how your
target is entered in the Chandra database.

search will be done using the coordinates returned by Simbad and a
cone of radius 4 arcmin.  The size of this cone may be changed by
entering a <A HREF="#RADIUS">radius</A> and <A HREF="#UNITS">units</A>.</TD></TR> 

<TR><TD valign="top"><B><A NAME="CATEGORY">Science Category<B></TD>
<TD>The Science Category of the Observation.  This field is the
